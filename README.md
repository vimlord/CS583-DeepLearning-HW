# Deep Learning (CS583) - Assignment Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains code and Jupyter notebooks submitted for the
Deep Learning course offered at the Stevens Institute of Technology.
I took the course as a senior undergraduate student as an elective
course in order to pursue my interest in Deep Learning and other Machine
Learning and Artificial Intelligence topics.

## Usage

To use the contents of this notebook, you will require the following
pieces of software:

* Python 3
* Tensorflow w/ Keras
* Jupyter

Python can be installed through your package manager, while Tensorflow,
Keras, and Jupyter can generally be installed through Python's package
management system.

## Relevant Sources

During the development of my assignments, I made use of Google's Collab
platform, which enables running of Jupyter notebooks with a GPU or TPU
in the cloud. The GitHub page for the course for which these materials
were published can be found [here](https://github.com/wangshusen/CS583A-2019Spring).

## Terms of Use

My university requires that I as a student abide by an honor code given by
the university. As such, usage requires that this code not be used to commit
an act of academic disonesty, including but not limited to submitting code
from this repository as the student's own creation. While very unlikely,
I do encourage the study of this code for the betterment and education of
anyone interested in learning about Deep Learning.
